Prevent user creation Ubuntu

isa in ubuntu can i prevent the creations of new user? for user are only the domain users

Yes, in Ubuntu you can prevent the creation of new users by configuring the system to only

allow domain users to log in. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the terminal and log in as the root user by running the following command:

Copy code

sudo su

2. Edit the "/etc/security/access.conf" file using your preferred text editor. For example, to
edit it with nano, run the following command:

bash Copy code

nano /etc/security/access.conf

3. Add the following line to the end of the file to allow only domain users to log in:

sql Copy code
-:ALL EXCEPT @domain-users:ALL
Replace "domain-users" with the name of the domain group that you want to allow to log
in.
4. Save the changes to the file and exit the text editor.

Restart the "sshd" service to apply the changes by running the following command:

Copy code

systemctl restart sshd

a it prevents even root user to create more users?

No, the method | described only restricts non-domain users from creating new user accounts
on the system. The root user can still create new user accounts as the root user has

administrative privileges.

If you want to prevent the root user from creating new user accounts as well, you can add

the following line to the "/etc/security/access.conf" file instead:

sql Copy code

-:ALL EXCEPT root @domain-users:ALL

This will allow only the root user and members of the "domain-users" group to log in to the

system and create new user accounts.

isa is there a way to have a history of whick command make which user in order?

Yes, there are several ways to keep track of which commands were executed by which users,

and in what order. Here are two options:
1. Use the "auditd" tool:

Auditd is a daemon that can be used to monitor and record system activity. It can keep track
of which users executed which commands, as well as other system events. To set up auditing,
you'll need to install the "auditd" package, and then configure the rules to monitor the

events you're interested in.

23/3/23, 21:46 Prevent user creation Ubuntu
For example, to monitor all commands executed by all users, you could add the following

rule to the "/etc/audit/audit.rules” file:

bash Copy code

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -k commands

This rule will log all commands executed by all users, and store the logs in the

"/var/log/audit/audit.log" file.
2. Use the "script" command:

The "script" command is a simple utility that can be used to record a terminal session. It
creates a file that contains a complete record of everything that was typed in the terminal, as

well as the output of each command.

To use "script" to keep track of user activity, you can create a separate log file for each user.
For example, you could create a directory called "/var/log/user-activity", and then run the

"script" command for each user, like this:

shell Copy code

script /var/log/user-activity/user1. log

This will start recording the user's terminal session to the “user1.log" file. When the user logs
out, you can start a new recording for the next user. You can then analyze the log files later

to see which commands were executed by which users, and in what order.

Note that this method relies on users voluntarily starting and stopping the recording of their

terminal sessions, so it may not be as reliable or complete as using a tool like “auditd”.

Yes, you can create a system-wide log file that captures all commands executed by all users
on the system. One way to do this is to use the "syslog-ng" tool, which is a flexible and
configurable syslog daemon that allows you to log and process system messages, including

commands executed by users.
To set up a system-wide log for all user commands, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the "syslog-ng" package using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu,
you can run the following command:

arduino Copy code

sudo apt-get install syslog-ng

2. Create a new configuration file for syslog-ng that defines the rules for logging user
commands. For example, you can create a new file called "/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/user-commands.conf" with the following contents:

scss Copy code

# Log all user commands to a separate file
filter f_user_commands { program("*/bin/|*/usr/bin/"); };
destination d_user_commands { file("/var/log/user-commands.log"); };

log { source(s_sys); filter(f_user_commands); destination(d_user_commands); };

This configuration file defines a filter that matches all commands executed by users (i.e.,
those that start with "/bin/" or "/usr/bin/"), and sends them to a separate log file called
"/var/log/user-commands.log".

3. Restart the "syslog-ng" service to apply the new configuration:

Copy code

sudo systemctl restart syslog-ng

Now, all user commands will be logged to the "/var/log/user-commands.log" file, including
the username, timestamp, and the command itself. You can analyze this log file to see which

commands were executed by which users, and in what order.

Note that this method may generate a large amount of log data, depending on how many
users and commands are executed on the system. You may want to rotate and archive the

log file periodically to avoid filling up the disk.

isa how can i rotate those files?

You can rotate the log files using the "logrotate" utility, which is a system tool that automates

the process of rotating, compressing, and deleting log files on a regular basis.
To configure logrotate for your user-commands log file, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new configuration file for logrotate in the "/etc/logrotate.d/" directory. For
example, you can create a file called "/etc/logrotate.d/user-commands" with the following
contents:

lua Copy code

/var/log/user-commands.log {
daily
missingok
rotate 7
compress
delaycompress
notifempty
create Q64@ root adm

This configuration file tells logrotate to rotate the "/var/log/user-commands.log" file on a
daily basis, keep up to 7 rotated files, compress the rotated files using gzip, delay
compression until the next rotation, and create a new empty log file with 0640
permissions owned by root and the adm group. The "missingok" and "notifempty"
options are there to handle cases where the log file is missing or empty, respectively.

2. Save the configuration file and exit.

23/3/23, 21:46 Prevent user creation Ubuntu

Now, logrotate will automatically rotate the user-commands log file on a daily basis,
compress the rotated files, and keep up to 7 rotated files. You can customize the rotation

frequency, retention policy, compression options, and other parameters to suit your needs.

Note that logrotate is typically run as a daily cron job, so the rotation may not happen
immediately after the configuration file is created or modified. You can force logrotate to run

manually using the "logrotate" command, or wait until the next daily cron job.

can syslog-ng log in json format? or can i insert some specific field to filter then in the syslog
server?

Yes, syslog-ng can log messages in JSON format, and you can also add custom fields to

messages to help with filtering and analysis.

To configure syslog-ng to log messages in JSON format, you can modify the destination in

the syslog-ng configuration file to use the "json" format, like this:

swift Copy code

destination d_user_commands {
file("/var/log/user-commands. log"
template("{\"timestamp\":\"$ISODATE\","
"\"hostname\":\"$HOST\","
"\"program\":\"$PROGRAM\","
"\"message\":\"$MSG\"}\n"
)

}3

This configuration uses the "template" directive to format the log messages as JSON objects

with the "timestamp", "hostname", "program", and "message" fields. You can customize this

template to include any other fields that you want to log or filter on.

To add custom fields to messages, you can use syslog-ng's built-in message processing

capabilities, such as filters, parsers, or rewrite rules. For example, you can add a filter to

https://chat.openai.com/chat/efe11939-bdf9-4424-b688-18c032afb07e

6/13
23/3/23, 21:46 Prevent user creation Ubuntu
match messages from a specific user or command, and then add a custom field to those

messages, like this:

swift Copy code

filter f_user_commands {
program("4/bin/|*/usr/bin/") ;
match("user=john" value("MESSAGE") ) ;
}3

rewrite r_add_user_field {
set ("user=john" value("MESSAGE") ) ;

i

destination d_user_commands {
file("/var/log/user-commands. log"
template("{\"timestamp\":\"$ISODATE\","
"\"hostname\":\"$HOST\","
"\"program\":\"$PROGRAM\", "
"\"user\":\"$USER\", "
"\"message\":\"$MSG\"}\n"

}3

log { source(s_sys);
filter(f_user_commands) ;
rewrite(r_add_user_field);
destination(d_user_commands) ;

33

This configuration adds a filter that matches commands executed by the "john" user, and a

rewrite rule that adds a "user=john" field to those messages. The destination uses the “user'

field in the log template to log the messages with the custom field included.

With these configurations, you can use tools like Elasticsearch or Logstash to index and
search the JSON log files, and filter or aggregate the messages based on any field, including

the custom fields you added.

a may i have some alert trigger for danger commands? if so, what commands should i be
aware of? does hacker use some specifics commands i'm not aware of?

< 2/2

Yes, you can set up alert triggers for dangerous or suspicious commands using tools like
OSSEC or Fail2ban. These tools monitor system logs and can trigger alerts or block IP

addresses when certain patterns or events are detected.

In terms of specific dangerous commands, it depends on your system and the software
installed on it. However, there are some common commands that are often used by attackers

to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions:

1. "ssh" - used for remote access to a system, often targeted by brute-force attacks.

2. "sudo" - used for executing commands with elevated privileges, often targeted by
privilege escalation attacks.

3. "wget" or "curl" - used for downloading files from the internet, often used to download
malware or exploit code.

4. "nc" or "netcat" - used for network connections and data transfer, often used to establish
backdoors or exfiltrate data.

5. "passwd" - used for changing passwords, often used in password cracking attacks.

These commands are not inherently dangerous, but they can be used for malicious purposes
if not properly secured or monitored. You should also be aware of any custom or third-party
commands that are installed on your system, as they may have vulnerabilities or be targeted

by attackers.

To set up alert triggers for these commands, you can configure OSSEC or Fail2ban to monitor
system logs for specific patterns or events, such as failed login attempts or unusual
command usage. You can also set up email or SMS alerts to notify you when a trigger is

activated, or block IP addresses that are associated with suspicious activity.

is in ubuntu, is there any way to check if a process or thread is hang?

Yes, you can check if a process or thread is hanging in Ubuntu using various tools. Here are

some options:

1. "top" command - This command displays the system's resource usage, including CPU and
memory usage, as well as the list of currently running processes. If a process is hanging or
using too much CPU, it will be highlighted in red. You can sort the processes by CPU
usage by pressing "Shift + P".

2. "htop" command - This is an interactive process viewer and system monitor similar to
"top" but with more advanced features. You can use "htop" to monitor CPU, memory, and
network usage, as well as sort processes by various criteria. If a process is hanging, it will
show up as "D" in the "STAT" column, indicating that it is in an uninterruptible sleep state.

3. "ps" command - This command displays the status of the currently running processes,
including their process ID (PID), parent process ID (PPID), CPU usage, and memory usage.
You can use the "ps" command with various options to display additional information
about the processes, such as their state (e.g., "R" for running, "S" for sleeping, "T" for
stopped, or "Z" for zombie). If a process is hanging, it may show up as "S" or "D" in the
"STAT" column.

4. "strace" command - This command allows you to trace system calls and signals made by a
process, which can help you diagnose issues such as hangs or crashes. You can use the
"strace" command with the "-p" option to attach to an already running process, or with
the command you want to trace. If a process is hanging, you may see a system call that is
taking a long time or not returning.

5. “lsof" command - This command lists all open files and network connections used by the
processes on the system. If a process is hanging, it may be waiting for a file or network
resource that is not available. You can use the "Isof" command to check if a process has

any open files or connections that are not responding.

These tools can help you identify and diagnose hanging processes or threads in Ubuntu. If
you suspect that a process is hanging or causing performance issues, you can use these tools
to gather more information and take appropriate actions, such as killing the process or

restarting the system.

a is there a way to automatize this monitoring and alert if so?

Yes, you can automate the monitoring of hanging processes and set up alerts in Ubuntu

using various tools. Here are some options:

1. Nagios - This is a popular open-source monitoring system that can be used to monitor
the availability and performance of servers, network devices, and applications. You can use
Nagios to monitor the status of processes and services, as well as set up alerts based on
specific criteria, such as CPU usage, memory usage, or process state.

2. Zabbix - This is another open-source monitoring system that can be used to monitor the
availability, performance, and security of servers, network devices, and applications. You
can use Zabbix to monitor processes and services, as well as set up alerts based on
specific thresholds or events.

3. Monit - This is a lightweight and easy-to-use utility for monitoring and managing
processes, files, directories, and network services. You can use Monit to monitor the status
of processes and set up alerts based on specific conditions, such as process state, CPU
usage, or memory usage.

4. Sysstat - This is a collection of utilities for monitoring system performance and usage,
including CPU usage, memory usage, and I/O usage. You can use Sysstat to monitor
processes and set up alerts based on specific conditions, such as CPU usage, disk usage,

or process state.

These tools can help you automate the monitoring of hanging processes and set up alerts to
notify you when specific conditions are met. You can configure these tools to monitor the
status of processes, set up thresholds or rules for alerts, and send notifications via email,
SMS, or other channels. By automating the monitoring and alerting process, you can ensure
that you are notified of issues in a timely manner and can take appropriate actions to prevent

or mitigate downtime.

is cani generate a script to stop the process that is hang to be called by zabbix when the cpu
alert is trigged?

Yes, you can generate a script to stop the hanging process and configure Zabbix to execute

the script when a CPU alert is triggered. Here's an example of how you can do this:

1.

Create a script to stop the hanging process. You can use the "kill" command to terminate
a process by its PID (Process ID). For example:

bash Copy code

kill -9 <PID>

Replace "<PID>" with the PID of the hanging process. You can get the PID of a process
using the "ps" command.

Save the script to a file, such as "stop_process.sh". Make sure the script is executable by
running the following command:

bash Copy code

chmod +x stop_process.sh

Configure Zabbix to execute the script when a CPU alert is triggered. You can do this by
creating a new action in Zabbix and specifying the script as the "Custom action" to be
executed. Here are the steps:

Go to the Zabbix web interface and navigate to "Configuration" > "Actions".

Click on "Create action" to create a new action.
* Enter a name for the action, such as "Stop hanging process".

In the "Conditions" tab, add a new condition for CPU usage. Set the threshold and
duration for the condition based on your requirements.

In the "Operations" tab, add a new operation. Select "Custom script" as the operation
type and enter the path to the script, such as "/path/to/stop_process.sh".

Click "Save" to save the action.

11/13
23/3/23, 21:46 Prevent user creation Ubuntu
When the CPU usage exceeds the threshold for the specified duration, Zabbix will execute

the script to stop the hanging process.

Note that terminating a process forcefully with the "kill -9" command may cause data loss or
corruption. Make sure you have taken appropriate backups or precautions before executing
the script. Additionally, consider investigating the cause of the hanging process to prevent it

from recurring in the future.

isa can i automatize the search for the pid?

Yes, you can automate the search for the PID of a hanging process using a script. Here's an

example of how you can do this:

bash Copy code

PROCESS_NAME="process_name"
PID=$(ps aux | grep $PROCESS_NAME | grep -v grep | awk ‘{print $2}')

if [ -n "$PID" ]; then
echo "Process $PROCESS NAME is running with PID $PID"
else
echo "Process $PROCESS NAME is not running"
fi

Replace "process_name" with the name of the process you want to monitor. The script uses
the "ps aux" command to list all processes, filters the output to only show processes with the
specified name, removes any lines containing the "grep" command itself, and extracts the

second column of the output, which contains the PID.

You can modify the script to include additional checks or actions, such as logging the status
of the process, stopping the process if it is hanging, or sending an alert if the process is not

running. You can also integrate the script with a monitoring tool such as Zabbix to automate
the monitoring and alerting process.
